when u login with browser, server saves a session id in browser using cookie 

server sends a response which has a set-cookie header which contains session id
which it save in browser.

-------------------

from now on, this cookie(session id) will send with all requests u send 

when u wana go to posts page, this session id is in all requests and 
server checks the data stored in server with that session id to see 
if user is logged in or other checkings :D  

if everything was correct, u can access to posts page ( if u have perm )

--------------------

this method is called session base auth which uses session & cookie to 
authenticat user

to api chetor auth mishe:

momkene az browser request biad ya az mobile, windows va...

dg inja ha nemishe session base use beshe chon browserii nis 
ke bekhiam session id set konim

so we should use token authentication

------------------

each user has a unique token and its needed to go to diffrent pages,
or access resources

-------------------

# 1: client wants to get list of all users,

we have an auth middleware which all 
users should be auth to access users 
if not login, server sends 401 un authorize 

so, user/client sends req to /login and sends user and pass.

server checks them, if its correct, generates a token and sends it 
with response to client and saves the token to db.

tokesn are used for authentication.

tokens are unique for each user

and this token will be in all requests which user sends

jwt is a type of token.
jwt hamon token hastesh which sends to client.

---------------

mobile developer should save the token in somewhere.

windows software developer should do it too.

-----------------

now u wana get users, the token should send with request.

server checks the token and if it was ok, server returns the response 
( list of users or other responses... )

-----------------------------

token is used to ensure that you are 
a registered user
and http is steateless and can not 
hold the datas of a connection and we 
can not use session base (cookie) auth

so we use the tokens.

-----------------------------

we can give perms & roles to users even with api. ( dastresi ha )

-------------------

a user login with ios, then login with andorid or other device 

for each device, a token will be generated after he/she get login :D 

tokens are unique for each device.

user and pass are same, but the token is diffrent :D

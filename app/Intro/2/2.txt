restfull api is base on rest architecture

in rest architecture we have state less behaviour but we need 
state full behaviour for Authentication.

we use api token for having statefull communication 

we use api for telling our software that the user has 
logged in before

-----------------------------

when user send login request, if credentials are ok, he get authenticated,
and we generate a token in backend and send to client using json
in the response.

client should store this token in local storage or anywhere.

from now, for each request that client wants to send, it should 
send that token using the authentication header of the requests (per request)

key ==> Authorization
value ==> Bearer [token]


where ever we need to check if user is authenticated or not,
we use that token.

-----------------------------

so, in all requests, this token must be available ==> per request.

-----------------------------

token can have expire time 

-----------------------------

so we can find out that the user is authenticated or not 

-----------------------------

we have several packages for authentication in laravel 
like sanctum, passport &...

-----------------------------

sanctum can work in stateless and statefull mode.
( statefull and stateless communication )

-----------------------------

we can have سطح دسترسی feature in sanctum but its better 
not to use sanctum for سطح دسترسی because maybe we wana 
change sanctum later 

so its better to just use it for authentication only.

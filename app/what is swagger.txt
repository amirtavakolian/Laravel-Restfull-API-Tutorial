after coding api, you have to create a documentation for it.
so everybody can easily findout how to use your api & what they can do with that api

what endpoints are available
what parameters each api needs
what http method they have
what headers are needed
what responses are available
what status code
info about the body of requests and responses &...

with this document, all above question will have answer and the front developer will no need
to every moment come to you and ask you about the api you have wrote.

Ex: what parameters shall i send for x endpoint, what method &... ==> go read the document :))

---------------------------------

even if you are working on a project alone (full stack), you have to write a document for your api,
so there is no need to always check the route and controllers for parameters, http methods &...

no time-consuming, no energy consuming anymore ==> so, create a document for you apis.

---------------------------------

swagger is base on open ai standard which is a bunch of tools which we can do
lots of works such as: writing document, testing end point with browser like postman  =>
send request & get response &...

so everybody can see the endpoints parameters, methods & etc... & test them

the swagger document is in json or yaml
finally that json or yaml will be converted to a visual output.

there are diffrent packages for swagger for diffrent langs which make
working with json easier. ==> using annotaions for controller methods
and that json file will be generated.

-----------------------------

with DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger package we will not struggle with working with json files.

we just define annotaions of our methods and that json file of swagger will get updated
==> our work get easier \:D/
